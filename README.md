# MyWork
## abstract
To provide the students with a better understanding of the concepts of compiler design I provide the 
students with a set of Python programs in Pycharm that use the ANTLR compiler generator. The programs
implement different concepts succh as how to develop a lexer, parser, or attributed grammar.
